# COVID19-Misinformation-Dataset
COVID-19 misinformation dataset is part of a  project that identifies and discovers real-time misinformation on Arabic Twitter using machine learning approaches. 
# Dataset Overview
COVID-19 misinformation repository contains the dataset of already annotated tweets ids over a span from March 2020 to April  2020. In total, the COVID19  misinformation dataset consists of 8,786 Arabic tweets. The annotated misinformation dataset covers significant, misleading, and inaccurate content that was widely shared among Arab Twitter users during the early months of COVID-19  ( March and April). The number of tweets containing misinformation in April is  709 tweets and 602 tweets in March. The table below shows general statistics about the dataset.


| Misinformation | Not Misinformation | Total         | 
| :---:          |     :---:          |      :---:    |
| 1,311          |7,475               | 8,786         |  




# Dataset annotated
Two Arabic native speaker volunteers labeled the tweets. Before labeling the tweets, the annotators reviewed a list of collected misinformation reported on both the World Health Organization (WHO) website and the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia website. The tweets which contains misinformation were labeled as "1" and others were labeled as  "0".   

# Guideline to Hydrate
 ### Using TWARC Notebook ### 
To hydrate the tweets-ID from our [COVID19-Misinformation-dataset](https://github.com/SarahAlqurashi/COVID19-Misinformation-dataset-) you can use our  [Hydrate_TweetIDs_Arabic_COVID19](https://github.com/SarahAlqurashi/COVID-19-Arabic-Tweets-Dataset/blob/master/Guideline%20to%20Hydrate/Hydrate_TweetIDs_Arabic_COVID19.ipynb) notebook.

* The notebook runs on google collab 
* You are required to have a Twitter developer account

For those who prefer  to use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) , We suggest using [Hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator).

 ### Using [Hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator)
